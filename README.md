# Take payments IRL with Solana Pay

This repository was built with instruction from the [Pointer Solana Pay Tutorial](pointer.gg/tutorials/solana-pay-irl-payments)

This tutorial explores Transfer Requests, more advanced Transaction Requests, and manages to teach users how to create SolanaPay URLs and insert them into QR codes which can be interacted with via mobile wallets like Phantom.
